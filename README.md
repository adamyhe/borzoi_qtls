# Borzoi QTLs

Curated set of QTLs used in the Borzoi paper (https://github.com/calico/borzoi). It's a little tricky to download these from the official data bucket, as the entire thing is set to "Requester Pays". I downloaded the entire dataset last year for a project and decided to post the QTLs in a public repo for improved accessiblity.
